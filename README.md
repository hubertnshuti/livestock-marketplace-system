## 📝 About the Project

**ItungoHub** is a web-based platform designed to modernize the traditional livestock market (*Amabagiro*) in Rwanda. Currently, farmers face significant challenges including lack of market access, high transport costs, and reliance on middlemen. 

This system solves these problems by providing a centralized digital marketplace where:
1.  **Farmers** can list their herd, manage inventory, and receive direct inquiries.
2.  **Buyers** can search for verified livestock by species, location, and price.
3.  **Transactions** are secured through an **"Inquiry & Approval" workflow**, replacing the risky instant-buy model with a trust-based negotiation system suitable for the agricultural sector.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🚜 For Farmers
* **Digital Herd Management:** specific forms to list animals with details like Tag ID, Weight, Age, and Breed.
* **Sales Dashboard:** Real-time tracking of "Total Livestock" vs. "Sold Items".
* **Inquiry Management:** Receive purchase requests, view buyer contact details securely, and Approve/Reject sales.
* **Revenue Tracking:** Monitor completed sales and income.

### 🛒 For Buyers
* **Advanced Marketplace:** Filter livestock by **Species** (Cattle, Goats, Pigs), **Location** (District/Sector), and **Price Range**.
* **Smart Cart:** A "Self-Healing" cart system that ensures accurate pricing calculations.
* **Pay-on-Delivery Workflow:** Place inquiries without immediate payment; pay only after the farmer approves and delivery is arranged.
* **Order History:** Track the status of requests from "Pending" to "Approved" to "Delivered".

### 🛡️ System & Admin
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Distinct dashboards for Administrators, Farmers, and Buyers.
* **Secure Authentication:** Custom profile management for farming cooperatives and individual traders.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The project follows the **Model-View-Template (MVT)** architectural pattern standard in Django.

1.  **The View Layer:** Handles complex logic like the *Marketplace Filter Algorithm* (case-insensitive search) and the *Cart Calculation Engine*.
2.  **The Model Layer:** Uses a robust relational database schema linking `Farmers`, `LivestockItems`, `Orders`, and `OrderItems`.
3.  **The Template Layer:** Utilizes **Bootstrap 5** for a mobile-responsive design, essential for farmers accessing the site via smartphones.

* Go to **Dashboard** -> **Add Livestock** to list a new animal.
* Go to **Incoming Inquiries** to see the order placed by the buyer.
* Click the **Eye Icon** to view buyer details, then click **Approve**.

### 3. The Payment Simulation
* Log back in as the **Buyer**.
* Go to **My Orders**. The status is now "Approved".
* Click **Pay Now** to run the mobile money simulation.
